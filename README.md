Hello,

I have completed the MVC Camp Project under the guidance of Murat Yücedağ, which was published on YouTube, and I would like to share the details of the project with you.
The project was developed in parallel with dictionary websites. Users can enter desired topics to leave comments and message other users. Authors can showcase their profiles, add posts, and respond to comments made by users. Admins can manage categories and also message both users and authors.

User Panel

📍 Users can edit their information.
📍 They can view all topics.
📍 They can comment on the topics they choose and view comments from other users.
📍 They can send messages to other users, view incoming messages, and reply to them.

Admin Panel

📍Categories are listed, and operations like adding, deleting, and updating can be performed.
📍All comments are listed, and keywords can be searched by filtering.
📍Desired topics on the site can be viewed in Excel, CSV, or PDF formats.
📍Since authorization is required for login, users can only view the messages that are sent to them, create new messages, and respond to incoming messages.
📍With the authorization system, permission statuses can be changed, and the pages visible to each permission level are different.
